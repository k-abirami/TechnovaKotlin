# JustInTime

## Inspiration
Inspired by a shared commitment to personal safety, our hackathon project, JustInTime, was born out of a deep-seated concern for the well-being of individuals everywhere. Our team's passion lies in addressing a crucial issue: the need for quick and efficient communication during emergencies. We recognize that in moments of danger or distress, time is of the essence, and traditional methods of seeking help may not suffice.

With JustInTime, we aim to provide a solution that enables users to call for assistance and alert their closest contacts and emergency services with a single voice command. This project showcases our commitment to creating a safer world where a simple command can potentially save lives. In emergencies, every second counts, and JustInTime is our contribution to making those seconds matter.

## What it does
Upon initial registration, users are prompted to designate their emergency contacts, which can include friends and family members. When faced with a dire situation or an environment that triggers feelings of insecurity, users can swiftly access the app. With a single click, they can utilize the microphone to verbally communicate their distress, activating a coordinated response.

Our application ensures that, in times of danger, every second counts. By immediately alerting the emergency contacts the user has previously specified, as well as the appropriate helpline—whether it's the Kids Help Line, the police, or the fire department—JustInTime guarantees a rapid and comprehensive response. In addition, JustInTime includes an automatic geo-location sharing feature, providing crucial information about the user's whereabouts to enhance the effectiveness of the response and ensure their safety.


## How we built it
We began by designing JustInTime in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/hh0AsH0PfTsSs9jUaF6xW9/prototype?type=design&node-id=3-541&t=uKmms4t6CUDcECqe-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=3%3A2&starting-point-node-id=3%3A541&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design), which allowed us to prototype and plan future features. The app itself was developed using Android Studio Projects with Kotlin. Notable features included speech-to-text transcription and real-time text notifications to emergency contacts. We also integrated OpenAI's API to map the text to the appropriate emergency helpline.


## Challenges we ran into

Integration Complexity: Integrating various technologies, such as AI, geo-location, and emergency services, required careful planning and execution.

 Using new technologies for the first time: No one in our team had experience with Android Studio and Kotlin so it was a steep learning curve and we spent a lot of time debugging code 
Speech Recognition Accuracy: Achieving high accuracy in speech recognition, especially during stressful situations or noisy environments, was a significant challenge. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of ourselves for creating a functional application! In particular, we are stoked in learning Kotlin and Android Studio, and successfully applying our newfound knowledge to create a useful application. Additionally, we are proud of our Figma design. We prioritized an aesthetic, user-friendly interface, making the app intuitive and easy to use, especially in high-stress situations. 

## What we learned
Android Studio with Kotlin
We learned how to implement speech-to-text translation, enabling the app to convert spoken words into text data for further processing.
We explored the integration of OpenAI API to process the information to output relevant emergency helplines 
How to send SMS messages from an app in real time 



## What's next for Just in Time
Incident Database: We can implement a database to store incident data. This will enable us to alert users of the app who are in or near that location to exercise caution, creating a community of safety-conscious individuals.

Machine Learning Enhancement: Our vision involves further training our machine to recognize complex emergency scenarios, ensuring a more refined and effective response to a wider range of situations.

Accessibility: We are committed to making Just in Time accessible to individuals with disabilities, ensuring that everyone can benefit from its safety features.

Multilingual Support: To increase accessibility on a global scale, we can expand the app's speech recognition capabilities to recognize and respond in multiple languages, making it a valuable tool for users around the world.
